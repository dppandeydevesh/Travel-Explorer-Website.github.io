# Travel Explorer Website üåç

This is a simple and clean travel website I built to help users discover new destinations. You can search for any city, and it will fetch beautiful photos and the live weather for that location.

## ‚ú® About The Project

I built this project as a way to practice my front-end development skills, especially working with external APIs. I found that planning a trip can be a hassle because information is so scattered. My goal was to create a single page where a user could get both visual inspiration (photos) and practical information (weather) for any destination they are curious about.
